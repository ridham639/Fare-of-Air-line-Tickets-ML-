Modeling fare ticket prices is a critical task in the transportation industry, encompassing airlines, railways, and other modes of travel. The primary objective is to predict ticket prices based on various 
factors such as demand, seasonality, competition, and passenger characteristics. By accurately predicting prices, companies can optimize revenue, manage inventory, and provide competitive pricing to attract customers.

Decision Tree and Random Forest in Fare Ticket Pricing
Decision Tree: A Decision Tree is a simple yet powerful algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In the context of fare ticket pricing, a Decision Tree can model the relationship between input 
features (e.g., travel date, booking date) and the target variable (ticket price). The tree is constructed by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on feature values, leading to a tree-like structure of 
decision nodes and leaf nodes. Each path from the root to a leaf represents a decision rule, and the leaf nodes provide the predicted ticket prices. Decision Trees are easy to interpret and visualize, but they can 
suffer from overfitting, especially with complex datasets.

Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that addresses the limitations of Decision Trees by combining multiple trees to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. 
In a Random Forest, numerous Decision Trees are built using random subsets of the training data and features. Each tree makes its own prediction, and the final prediction is obtained by 
averaging the predictions (for regression tasks) or taking a majority vote (for classification tasks). This approach reduces the risk of overfitting and enhances the model's generalization capability. 
In fare ticket pricing, Random Forest can capture complex interactions between features and provide more accurate and reliable predictions compared to a single Decision Tree.

By leveraging Decision Trees and Random Forests, transportation companies can develop sophisticated fare ticket pricing models that help optimize pricing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue.
